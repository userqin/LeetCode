# Backtracking

## Definitions:

According to wiki, backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem.

## Use cases

Three types of problems in backtracking:

* Decision Problem – search for a feasible solution.
* Optimization Problem – search for the best solution.
* Enumeration Problem –  find all feasible solutions.

## Classical problems

In leetcode, classical backtracking problems include:

* 51. N-Queens
