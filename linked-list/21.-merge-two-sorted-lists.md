### Problem statement

### Analysis

* Step1: construct a `dummy_head`, `prev = dummy_head`，dummy\_head is sued as return head
* Step 2: Use a while loop to compare the `l1.val` and `l2.val`. Scan through `l1`、`l2`，if `l1.val < l2.val`，then point `prev.next` to `l1`. Vice versa, point to `l2`. Move prev to the next.  If one of l1, l2 lists is finished, then we finish while loop.
* Step 3: check if  there nodes left in l1 or l2 after while loop.  If yes, connect prev node to the current node of l1 or l2 \(the list that has unfinished nodes \)
* Step 4: return `dummy_head.next`.
