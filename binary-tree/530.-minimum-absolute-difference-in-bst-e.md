# 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST \(E\)

### [Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/)

### Problem statement

Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum [absolute difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference) between values of any two nodes.

**Example:**

```text
Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
```

**Note:**

* There are at least two nodes in this BST.
* This question is the same as 783: [https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/)

### Analysis

### Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
```
