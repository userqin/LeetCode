# 283. Move Zeroes

## [Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

## Problem statement

Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Note**:

1. You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.

## Solution:

**Analysis**:

Define two pointers:

* One is used to swipe through all elements in the array
* One is used to track the examined none-zero value

### Method 1:

**Analysis:** Remember to smartly use   `.append()`,  and  `.remove()`

 Be careful about what really happens when using~~`.pop(index),`~~for example in \[0, 0, 1 \]

```python
class Solution(object):
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        for num in nums:
            if num == 0:
                nums.remove(num)
                nums.append(num)
        return nums
```
