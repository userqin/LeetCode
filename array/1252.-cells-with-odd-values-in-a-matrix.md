# 1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix

### Problem link

### Problem statement

Given `n` and `m` which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros and given an array `indices` where `indices[i] = [ri, ci]`. For each pair of `[ri, ci]` you have to increment all cells in row `ri` and column `ci` by 1.

Return _the number of cells with odd values_ in the matrix after applying the increment to all `indices`.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/30/e1.png)

```text
Input: n = 2, m = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
The final matrix will be [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]] which contains 6 odd numbers.
```

**Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/30/e2.png)

```text
Input: n = 2, m = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Final matrix = [[2,2],[2,2]]. There is no odd number in the final matrix.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 50`
* `1 <= m <= 50`
* `1 <= indices.length <= 100`
* `0 <= indices[i][0] < n`
* `0 <= indices[i][1] < m`

### Analysis

**Method II：hashmap**

* Traverse all indices，calculate how many `+ 1`operations there are for each row and for each column. Use two dictionaries to record `+ 1`operations
* Traverse the matrix again, find out number of `+ 1`operations for each `matrix[i][j]`
* Check each `matrix[i][j]` to see if it is even or odd and use  `count` to track the number of odd elements in the matrix. 

**Method III：mathematically**

* For each `nums[i][j]`，namely, for ith row and jth col, its value is how many times `i,j`appears in indices.
* We only need to  calculate the sum of `i,j:`if it is even, then `nums[i][j]`

  is even;  if it is odd, then `nums[i][j]`is odd.

* **Trick :**  
  * even + even  must be an even ; 
  * even + odd must be an odd;
  * odd + odd must be an even.

Finally, we only need to know  if `i, j`are even or odd，and we don't need to know their exact values. Therefore we count the times of `+ 1`operations for each`nums[i][j].`
