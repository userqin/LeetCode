# 54. Spiral Matrix \(M\)

## [Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)

### Problem statement

Given a matrix of _m_ x _n_ elements \(_m_rows, _n_ columns\), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9,10,11,12]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

### Hints:

**hint 1:**  Well for some problems, the best way really is to come up with some algorithms for simulation. Basically, you need to simulate what the problem asks us to do.

**hint 2:** We go boundary by boundary and move inwards. That is the essential operation. First row, last column, last row, first column and then we move inwards by 1 and then repeat. That's all, that is all the simulation that we need.

**hint 3:** Think about when you want to switch the progress on one of the indexes. If you progress on `i`out of `[i, j]`, you'd be shifting in the same column. Similarly, by changing values for `j`, you'd be shifting in the same row. Also, keep track of the end of a boundary so that you can move inwards and then keep repeating. It's always best to run the simulation on edge cases like a single column or a single row to see if anything breaks or not.

### Analysis:

Use hints!

The moving order is starting from `[0 , 0]` , and then right-down and left up. THe key is to identify the turning point. Use four variables `t, d, l, r`  to represent 4 boundaries.

* initialize `t, d, l, r`to be the boundaries of the original matrix.
* define a direction tuple `dir`
  * if `dir = (0, 1)`, means to move towards the right boundary
  * if `dir = (0, -1)`, means to move towards the left boundary
  * if  `dir = (1, 0)`, means to move down
  * if `dir = (-1, 0)`, means to move up
* everytime we visit a new point in the matrix, save this point to an array, and get the next point's coordinates based current moving direction `dir:`
  *  when moving to the right and reaching the right boundary `r`, change `dir = (0, 1)` to moving down `dir = (1, 0)`and `r -= 1`
  *  when moving downwards and reaching the bottom boundary `b`, change `dir = (1, 0)` to moving left `dir = (0, -1)` and `b -= 1`
  * when moving left and reaching the left boundary `l`, change `dir = (0, -1)` to moving up `dir = (-1, 0)` and `l -= 1`
  * when moving upward and reaching the top boundary `t,` change `dir = (-1, 0)` to moving to the right `dir = (0,1)`and `t -= 1`
  * when not touching any boundaries, continue to move forward along the current moving dirction `[right, left, up, down]`
