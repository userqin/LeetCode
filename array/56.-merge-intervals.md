# 56. Merge Intervals

### [Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

### Problem statement

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

### Analysis:

### Solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        if not intervals:
            return None
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])
        
        p0 = intervals[0][0]
        p1 = intervals[0][1]
        res = []
        
        for ele in intervals:
            if ele[0] <= p1:
                p1 = max(p1, ele[1])
            else:
                res.append([p0,p1])
                p0 = ele[0]
                p1 = ele[1]
        
        res.append([p0, p1])
        return res
```
