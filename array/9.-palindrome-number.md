# 9. Palindrome Number

## [Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

## **Problem statement**

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 121
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Follow up:**

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?



**Some hints:**

* Could negative integers be palindromes? \(ie, -1\)
* If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
* You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem “Reverse Integer”, you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
* There is a more generic way of solving this problem.

## Solution

From the hints we learned that:

* Negative integers cannot be palindromes
* converting a integer to a string violates the O\(1\) space constraint
* If we reverse a integer, watch out for overflow
* This problem can be solved by a generic way

In addition, 0 should be a palindrome

**Analysis:**

Since we cannot convert the integer to a string, we can try to generate a reversed integer. 

## Method 1 : reverse the integer and then compare

In Python there is no overflow issue \(which is not the case in C++\). Since the integer to be evaluated doesn't overflow, so the reversed one also won't overflow.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if x < 0 :
            return False
        
        tmp = x
        y = 0
        while tmp:
            y = tmp % 10 + y * 10
            tmp = tmp // 10
        return y == x
```

## Method 2 : optimize method 1

Just reverse half of x and compare it

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if x < 0:
            return False
        y = 0
        while x > y:
            y = y * 10 + x % 10
            x //= 10
        return x == y or x == y // 10 
```
