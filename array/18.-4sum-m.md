# 18. 4Sum \(M\)

### Problem link

### Problem statement

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers and an integer `target`, are there elements _a_, _b_, _c_, and _d_ in `nums` such that _a_ + _b_ + _c_ + _d_ = `target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of `target`.

**Note:**

The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

**Example:**

```text
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

### Analysis

Convert it to be two-sum problem:

*  Build a dictionary，`key`is the sum of two numbers，`value` is their  indices as a tuple. **Note:**  One key can have multiple tuples of indices. Thus,  `value`is a list and each element in it a tuple of two elements' indices.
* After the dictionary is built,  use two pointers `i` and `j` to look for `tmp = target - nums[i] - nums[j]`: if `tmp` is in dictionary，indicating that corresponding to indices  `i` and `j`，there are another two numbers together with nums\[i\] and nums\[j\] will have a sum that is equal to target. Just find the indices that are saved in `dic[key]`
* To avoid duplicates in the quadruplets, sort `nums` first.  And for `i`

   and `i`, check if new index is greater than  `j`

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def fourSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        
```
