# 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60 \(E\)

### Problem link

### Problem statement

In a list of songs, the `i`-th song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds. 

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by `60`.  Formally, we want the number of indices `i`, `j` such that `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

### Analysis

Very similar to `Two Sum`! `Two Sum` is to find the sum that is equal to `target`.是 This problem is to find  two songs whose sum are divisible by 60. 

If the sum of two numbers are divisible by 60, then there are two possible cases:

*  these two numbers are divisible by 60 themselves, namely `n1 % 60 ==0 and n2* 60 ==0` 
* the sum of reminders of these two numbers divided by 60 are divisible by 60, namely,  `n1 % 60 + n2 % 60 = 60`

Therefore, 

**firstly**:

we build an array `a`，and use `a[i]`to represents the  number of time durations  whose reminder when divided by 60 is `i`. Or we can use a dictionary to do so. 

**secondly:**

traverse the `time` list, check the reminder for each element in the list, say `time[i]` : if reminder is 0, then `a[0]` is the number of pairs that satisfies the first condition given current `time[i]`; if the reminder is != 0, then `a[60 - i]` is the number of pairs that satisfies the second condition given current `time[i]`.

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time):
        """
        :type time: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        d = {}
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(time)):
            val = time[i]
            if val % 60 == 0:
                count += d.get(0, 0)
                d[0] = d.get(0, 0) + 1
            else:
                count += d.get(60 - val % 60, 0)
                d[ val % 60] = d.get(val % 60, 0) + 1
        
        return count
```

[循环遍历数组中每一个数字，查看当前数字的余数，如果余数为0，那么当前count\[0\]的个数就是与当前数能够组成的配对数。如果余数不为0，那么count\[60-当前余数\]的个数就是与当前数能够组成的配对数。之后我们将当前余数的count加一。循环完整个数组，我们也就统计出了最终的结果。](https://leetcode.jp/leetcode-1010-pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60-%E8%A7%A3%E9%A2%98%E6%80%9D%E8%B7%AF%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/)
