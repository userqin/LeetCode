# 392. Is Subsequence

### [Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

### Problem statement

Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some \(can be none\) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. \(ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not\).

**Follow up:**  
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k &gt;= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

**Credits:**  
Special thanks to [@pbrother](https://leetcode.com/pbrother/) for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

### Analysis

**Method I: greedy**

* use a queue to store s and traverse t
* when current character c of t is the same as head of the queue, pop out the head
* finally, check whether the queue is empty

**Method II: two pointers**

**Method III: binary search**

Finding a specific number in an ordered structure is the reason for the binary search label for this problem.

* Use hash set `d` to record the position of each character in t, that is, there are at most 26 keys
* Match each letter in `s`, `s[i]` must appear after `s[i-1]`, so when matching `s[i]`, we should find the index that `d[s[i]]` is greater than `d[s[i-1]]`
* We use **binary search** that matches the left boundary \(that is, match the first number greater than or equal to the target value\) to find the first value in the current letter index list that is greater than the previous letter index
* If a matching boundary value is equal to the length of the current subtitle index list, it indicates that the current letter cannot be matched, and returns False All successful matches return True
