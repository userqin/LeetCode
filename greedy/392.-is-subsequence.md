# 392. Is Subsequence

### [Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

### Problem statement

Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some \(can be none\) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. \(ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not\).

**Follow up:**  
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k &gt;= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

**Credits:**  
Special thanks to [@pbrother](https://leetcode.com/pbrother/) for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

### Analysis

**Method I: greedy**

* use a queue to store s and traverse t
* when current character c of t is the same as head of the queue, pop out the head
* finally, check whether the queue is empty

        :rtype: bool

        for c in t:
            if not q:
                return True
            if c == q[0]:
                q.pop(0)
        return len(q) == 0
