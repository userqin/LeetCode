# 455. Assign Cookies

### [Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

### Problem statement

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj &gt;= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Note:**  
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.  
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```

### Analysis

Essentially this problem is : For two arrays `g` and `s` , find the most number of pairs of `(i,j)` that satisfies `g[i] <= s[j]`

**Method 1 : greedy**`starting with the kid has the lowest greed factor and the smallest cookie. If the current cookie size is smaller the current kid's greed factor, move to the next cookie which has a larger size than the current one.`

* Sort both children array and cookies array, put the child with the smallest greedy factor and the smallest size of cookie in the beginning.
* traverse each element `g[i]` in `g` from the beginning to the end, and mark the current position in `s` as `j` \(initialize `j` as `0`\)
* for each element `g[i]` in `g,`traverse `g`  starting from `j` , when satisfies `g[i] <= s[j]`  increase `i & j` by 1\(`s[i]`can only be used once\) .

**Method 1 : greedy**`starting with the kid has the highest greed factor and the largest cookie. If current kid has a greed factor larger than the current cookie size, move to the next kid who has a smaller greed factor.`

* Sort both children array and cookies array, put the child with the smallest greedy factor and the smallest size of cookie in the beginning.
* traverse each element `g[i]` in `g` from the end to the beginning, and mark the current position in `s` as `j` \(initialize `j` as `len(s)-1`\)
* for each element `g[i]` in `g,`traverse `g`  starting from `j` , when satisfies `g[i] <= s[j]`  decrease `i & j` by 1\(`s[i]`can only be used once\) . 
* use `count` to track the number of pairs of `(i,j)`that satisfies `g[i] <= s[j]`
